06 novembre 2024:
ZChallenge:
lpotenca's "fausse piste"
lpotenca: trop de pistes
lpotenca: se resservir du contexte

**lpotenca: contenu multi-usage
   poser des questions aux spectateurs ou à la même personne (live)
   workflow:
      1. creer le contenu
      2. réfléchir aux questions à poser sur ce contenu
      "ce serait un contenu qui pourrait durer pendant des mois" (!)

les gens du haut sont riches      
les gens du bas sont plus pauvres

les gens doivent dézoomer pour voir que l'image de départ était juste une partie d'autres images
      
**lpotenca: carte de france pour énigmes X éducation
***lpotenca's neveremptiness X back to top level scale
      when "distance"(screenPov, meaningful object) is too big then gotopov top level scale
      zooming-out from top level scale brings back to previous "meaningful pov" 

**lpotenca's question: will people be engaged enough ?

**lpotenca's greenLight validation: when user has been to target location, greenLight has answer near it
**shu's greenLight easy portal: zooming in greenLight gets to target pov
**lpotenca's hint system: zooming in redLight hint displays target but zooming out brings to redLight... (depressing !...) 

**lpotenca's growing universe:
      le type clique sur le billet et quand on est au niveau de zoom "univers", des questions sont apparues
         ce sont des questions de niveau de zoom 1

**shu: portal to 2nd universe: zooming in object that looks like universe object but brings to somewhere else
**lpotenca's parralel universe: everything is same same but different
   variant: silent hill mode


*lpotenca's click on square sequence:  
      click on squares and then a word appears

**lpotenca's de l'herbe pour la vache, un couteau pour le cuisinier
      solving la vache gives hammer, which you can give to le couvreur
      ((hammer can go in inventory
      hammer is GM
      if hammer is ditched, it goes back to its source location (à la GM)

07 novembre 2024:
around ghost_povIsInside : message appears when user has dived deep enough in ghost (because ghost_in disappears)

08 novembre 2024:
lpotenca's (closed) structure: 
      1.neveremptiness's portal brings back to rootPov
      2.there are portals allowing to go from A to C, etc.

shu: hint: "green, yellow, purple" 
      context: screen is full of interleaving strings of different colors
      player has to go where green, yellow and purple strings 3-meet

shu: hint "where I was born, yellow and red"
      neveremptiness_floodFill("this is my house") in placeA
      neveremptiness_floodFill("it smells good") in placeB
      neveremptiness_floodFill("this is where I was born") in placeC

shu's "le chien du facteur" 

14 novembre 2024:
from zNavigationPath to 2D grid of colored letters:
      player must translate the navigation path they took (each scenery having a main color) into the 2D grid of letters so that a message can be read

fakeWall (=="past the veil"): player thinks what they see is the maximum depth but they can actually dive farther in

constellations/address: in a world full of dots, like black stars, use the patterns formed by same homeScale stars as their "universe_address"

constellations: stars' ZSegments
      every player 'success' creates a ZSegment between 2 stars
      gradually, a message appears (it may be solely composed of geometrical shapes)
            for example:
                  a particular object of the universe may be represented with perspective (as if it were living in a 3d space)
                        with a '3D arrow' pointing to a particular location of the object

deshabillez-moi: rects have

**(*)tight space: when X is in position Y, Z becomes impossible.
      examples:
            Z can be:
                  crossing a portal (because exit is cluttered)
                  zooming-out from current scenery (because a ceiling has been put on)
**"remember, it's only 2D stuff": Lands of Lore X iC
      il y a des phases où l'on croit progresser dans un univers à la Lands of Lore
      mais il y a des phases où la supercherie est révélée car des morceaux 2D viennent se poser sur les écrans Lands of Lore
            ce qui peut rendre certains lieux "Lands of Lore" inaccessibles (à cause de mécaniques de tight space)

17 novembre 2024:
eoaiu: 
      zoom inside e: neveremptiness: e->o (temporary floor when arriving at o's inside)
      dezoom from o: temporary floor is removed
      zoom inside o: 
      il y a le "chemin de décodage" trous et il y a le "chemin de décodage" des "pleins": les deux chemins sont différents
            les trous sont colorés et le "chemin d'encodage" des trous a la couleur des trous
 
mots croisés en zFreeDrawing

find this color: background color changes with screenPov

beware of the dog: as user zooms in (in the area watched by the dog), an object gets closer to screenPov (to intercept screenPov), until 'user has been caught' and something happens

shu: black fog: darkness is an illusion
      zooming-in scenery changes background color to black, but all the objects on screen were black
      this is like a tutorial for "don't move the mouse, simply scroll in"
      => neverUnwholesomeness

color::color is func::la robe en or: there is a part where fillColor = f(screenPov.scale)
      those may be built using "color keyframe" where editor floodFill with the color they want to see at current screenPov.scale
      a gradient then auto computes color=f(screenPov.scale)

neveremptiness::death by zoomed-in: zooming in a non important part of the ZChallenge destroys it

un coin sûr: ghost appears when screenPov is around position (0,0) and scale S

mélanger 2D top-down, 2D lateral, 2.5D et fausse 3D dans la même image
      la pierre tombe verticalement puis dans l'écran ("la chute décore")
      la pierre tombe et à côté il y a une voiture de GTA 2

bottom-up content:
      finding something small reveals its bigger picture when zoomed out (which was not there when zooming in)

bottom-up content::collide: when X has been revealed, and Y has been revealed

fables de la fontaine:
      qui vole un oeuf, vole un boeuf
      aussi gros que le boeuf
      pas vendre la peau de l'ours (bottom-up)

timeout-door::user clicks on countdown button, this opens deep portal
      what player sees at first is the countdown 10,9,8,7,6... on the button after having pressed it
      at some point, player realizes the deep portal is opened by the countdown button

dive in dive out particular calendar date

18 novembre 2024:
slenderman's stigmata: here and there, there are signs of a 'stranger' having been there
      examples: 
            some glass has been drunk
            footSteps
            we even see some body parts of the stranger (a leg, a shoulder, etc.)

21 novembre 2024:
facebook world: people card with photo name, likes, dislikes...
      there are portals to the people they are connected to
distances on a graph:  d(Brian, Lucy)==4 : Brian Maslow -> Linda Cheny -> William Brant -> Albert Winston -> Lucy Harbinger
      player must go through portals
facebook world: instable persons: their friendly people's list changes at every 

the password is : "         "
      using a 'copy map', player has to find the color squares that have been displaced and compare it with the message "characters map"

25 novembre 2024:
chain of composite(composite(...)) with .isMobile: true
      the goal is to move each handle in the chain to recreate target shape

**chain of composite(composite(...)) with .isMobile: true for some, and .isMobile:false for some
      the goal is to move each handle in the chain to recreate target shape
      the difficulty lies in the fact that some parts of the chain are immutable

26 novembre 2024:
**[wrap] fun: target is a certain pattern that player has to build using wrapping touchSlots
      example: 
           [[E]] * [◽A] = [[ E A  ]] 
                   [C B]    [[ C B  ]]
            target is 6x6 grid for example

=>shu's minigames/aui's minigames
      collection of minigames (that, in the end, serve as a tutorial for aui)

27 novembre 2024:
zTetris

30 novembre 2024:
*photo-based: use perspective lines of photos to create polygons by putting photos side to side

02 décembre 2024:
named location: a particular place is now refered to as "<name>" and "<name>" is used in other hints

floodFill-based hint: a floodFill "puzzle piece" is displayed to player with a hint: player must find the same shape inside the canvas (and dive into hint location)
floodFill-based named location: player must find the same shape inside the canvas, this place is now refered to as "<name>"

03 décembre 2024:
**platform-based portal: put object(s) on portal's platform to: destination of portal is related to terraced object(s)
**money consuming platform-based portal: put enough money on portal's platform to activate it
**find-this platform-based portal: put X on portal and portal will lead you to the first instance of X that it finds on canvas
**token-count find-this platform-based portal: put 3 X on portal and portal will lead you to the 3rd instance of X that it finds on canvas

04 décembre 2024:
born_with_a_name: hint is based on the name of the variable
      example: "in the eye of cindy", when there are many many variablized people, each with a name

*bizarre image bank: create 100 bizarres images and build a zChallenge using them only

05 décembre 2024:
se moquer des marques déposées et autres chimères réservées de la propriété intellectuelle
      don't forget that the nature is a reserved trademark of the nature

**portal to hardGhost/portal to nowhereGhost: versionA/versionB
      versionA is facade of a portal which leads to versionB (since portal brings to relative pov, we can relate the two versions (hide smth in version2 for example))
      versionB is a hardGhost: 
            hardGhost: 
                  a hardGhost is something that can only be stared at, only if you have been brought to, or else it vanishes (any innerMove will lead to its vanishing)
                  variant: any innerMove (pan or zoom or whatever) leads to being brought to hardGhost.end

*autour des icEntrance: 
      get the right color:
            everytime user crosses entrance, its bg color changes, so that objects inside it are revealed or hidden (à la Runbow)
            there are many such entrances

06 décembre 2024:
"ne touche pas le plafond": user must pan so that they don't cross outPortal, and can then access to a new area

shotgunPortal: portal leads to random(portal.arr_rect_out)

telescope: telescope(portal_in) --> moon(portal_out)

telescope::user moves telescope (simply pan): there are obvious telescope starting locations
      telescope.portal_out is so small that user cannot get to destinations without using the telescope
      example:
            A     B                 and  targets are very very very very very very very very small.

            c     D 

10 décembre 2024:
zPixel::broken-zLevels zPixelImage: user has to mentally rebuild the image that is broken into different zLevelChunks
      "+ix": vertically   sliced
      "+iy": horizontally sliced: for example, write some text, each successor text line at the successor zLevel

11 décembre 2024:
battle between pixelBrush and pencilBrush: "cyborg" pixel/pencil
    worfklow: 
      1.draw the object entirely with pencilBrush
      2.animate some of the strokes by transforming then into zPixelStrokes and then back into pencil strokes

16 décembre 2024:
sparse-pixel-chars strings: sparse yellow pixels compose a hint when seen from afar

18 décembre 2024:
**(*)use upscaler to enrich part of picture and be able to lessen the pixelized feeling when diving in it

      Neveremptiness X loop : after 5 neveremptiness on thé same object (Nemp(X):X,Nemp(X):X, etc.) another neveremptiness destination unloxks

      Neveremptiness X playing cards : ask user to do 5C, 7H, AS, 6D with the following rules C->C,H,D , H->D,S, S->C, D-> : user has to 'enter' more cards than displayed so as to follow thé asked pattern
      There could also be rules on card values (this is a challenge of logic)
      Same thing with more than 2 catégories : firstname, surname, âge, etc. And thé asked pattern is a séquence of ids

      Thé Bomb (à la majora's mask): ultra small object keeps growing as time passes by : in the end, the whole ZChallenge area is covered by thé bomb

      Paradise lost: scenery containing all solutions is accessible once, at thé beginning, then all paths are way longer. Paradise is never to be accessed again.


      Back-to-prev _ghost_: previous pov ghost-fades in when zooming out from starting pov

      Stare : to trigger something, pov has to stay the same for n seconds

      Find the path (without mistake) : la vache > la mouche > le chien > le dollar (inside every scenery there is a portal to each of the sceneries).
      This allows :
      La vache > la vache > la vache ...
      So that there can be la vache 1, .. , la vache n, and then it loops back to la vache 1 (scenery variants)
      To go to universeX, player has to follow a particular scenePathX, to go to universeY, scenePathY, etc.
